# LeetCode Study Repository Copilot Instructions

## Repository Structure & Purpose

This is a comprehensive algorithm learning repository focused on LeetCode problem solutions across multiple programming languages. The repository follows a structured approach to algorithm mastery using a 5-round learning methodology.

## File Organization Patterns

### Language-Specific Solutions
- **`cpp/`**, **`python/`**, **`java/`**, **`golang/`**, **`rust/`**: Problem solutions by language
- **Naming Convention**: `{problem_number}_{problem_name}.md` (e.g., `001_two_sum.md`)
- **File Format**: Markdown files containing problem description, multiple solution approaches, and complexity analysis

### Algorithm Topic Categorization
- **Topic Files**: `hashtable.md`, `dp.md`, `bfs.md`, `dfs.md`, `tree.md`, etc.
- **Purpose**: Quick reference for problems by algorithmic pattern
- **Content**: Links to related problems, often with difficulty ratings

### Study Resources
- **`template/jiuzhang_template.md`**: Comprehensive algorithm templates and patterns
- **`ClassifyByCompany.md`**: Problems organized by tech companies for interview prep
- **`GrokkingTheCodingInterviewPatternInPython/`**: Pattern-based problem groupings

## Solution File Format Standards

Each solution file follows this structure:
```markdown
# Problem Title

[[tag]] (e.g., [[hashtable]])

Problem description...

Time/Space complexity analysis...

```language
// Solution code with comments
```

Alternative approaches and optimizations...
```

## Key Development Patterns

### Problem Analysis Workflow (4-step process)
1. **Clarification**: Understand problem requirements thoroughly
2. **Multiple Solutions**: Analyze different approaches with complexity trade-offs
3. **Implementation**: Code the optimal solution
4. **Test Cases**: Validate with edge cases

### Learning Methodology (5-round system)
- **Round 1**: Study and understand solutions
- **Round 2**: Implement independently 
- **Round 3**: Practice after 24 hours
- **Round 4**: Review after one week
- **Round 5**: Final review before interviews

## Content Creation Guidelines

### When Adding New Solutions
- Create files in appropriate language directory using naming convention
- Include problem description, multiple approaches, and complexity analysis
- Add cross-references to relevant topic files (e.g., `[[hashtable]]`)
- Provide clean, commented code with explanations

### Topic File Maintenance
- Update topic files when adding related problems
- Include difficulty ratings when available
- Maintain links to specific solution files

### Template Usage
- Reference `template/jiuzhang_template.md` for standard algorithm patterns
- Follow established patterns for BFS, DFS, binary search, etc.
- Include time/space complexity analysis for all solutions

## Quick Reference

- **Find by Pattern**: Check topic files (`.md` files in root)
- **Find by Company**: Use `ClassifyByCompany.md`
- **Algorithm Templates**: Reference `template/jiuzhang_template.md`
- **Multi-language**: Solutions available in `cpp/`, `python/`, `java/`, `golang/`, `rust/`

When helping with this repository, prioritize code clarity, include complexity analysis, and maintain the established file organization patterns.
