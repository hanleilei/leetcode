# Roman to integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

首先将罗马数字翻转，从小的开始累加，如果遇到CM（M-C=1000-100=900），因为翻转过来是MC，M=1000先被累加，所以使用一个last变量，把M记录下来，如果下一个数小于M，那么减两次C，然后将C累加上，这个实现比较巧妙简洁。

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        d = {"I": 1, "V": 5, "X": 10, "L": 50, "C":100, "D": 500, "M": 1000}
        res = 0
        cache = None

        for i in s[::-1]:
            if cache and cache > d[i]:
                res -= d[i] * 2
            res += d[i]
            cache = d[i]
        return res
```

或者：

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        values = [ 1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1 ]
        numerals = [ "M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I" ]
        d = dict(zip(numerals, values))

        res = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i] + s[i+1] in d:
                res += d[s[i] + s[i+1]]
                i += 2
            else:
                res += d[s[i]]
                i += 1
        return res
```
