# unique paths ii

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
```

Output: 2
Explanation:

```
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        m, n, dp = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0]), [0, 1]
        dp += [0] * (n - 1)
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                dp[j] = (not obstacleGrid[i-1][j-1]) * (dp[j] + dp[j-1])
        return dp[-1]
```

再来一个二维的DP：

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1:
                break
            dp[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(n):
            if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 1:
                break
            dp[0][j] = 1
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    continue
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
```
