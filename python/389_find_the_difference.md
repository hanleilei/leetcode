# Find the difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

### 这个算是抖了个机灵，完全利用了collections库里面的Counter函数。

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        from collections import Counter
        a = Counter(s)
        b = Counter(t)
        b.subtract(a)
        for i in b.keys():
            if b[i]:
                return i

```
