# Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?


Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

The array may contain duplicates

参考33题，正常的按照二分法来做。注意会有重复元素.

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r-l)//2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return True
            while l < mid and nums[l] == nums[mid]: # tricky part
                l += 1
            # the first half is ordered
            if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
                # target is in the first half
                if nums[l] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            # the second half is ordered
            else:
                # target is in the second half
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
        return False
```
