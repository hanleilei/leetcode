# distinct subsequences

Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

## Example 1

```text
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
```

```Python
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        l1, l2 = len(s)+1, len(t)+1
        cur = [0] * l2
        cur[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, l1):
            pre = cur[:]
            for j in range(1, l2):
                cur[j] = pre[j] + pre[j-1]*(s[i-1] == t[j-1])
        return cur[-1]

```
