# intersection of two linked list

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗
B:     b1 → b2 → b3

bThe test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

Custom Judge:

The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
listA - The first linked list.
listB - The second linked list.
skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_1_1.png)

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

Example 2:

![3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_2.png)

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Example 3:

![4](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)

Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

Constraints:

The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= Node.val <= 105
0 <= skipA <= m
0 <= skipB <= n
intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.

Follow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?

先来一个大家都能直观想到的：

```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        currA, currB = headA, headB
        lenA, lenB = 0, 0

        while currA:
            lenA += 1
            currA = currA.next
        while currB:
            lenB += 1
            currB = currB.next

        currA, currB = headA, headB
        if lenA < lenB:
            extra = lenB - lenA
            while extra > 0:
                extra -= 1
                currB = currB.next
        elif lenB < lenA:
            extra = lenA - lenB
            while extra > 0:
                extra -= 1
                currA = currA.next

        while currA != currB:
            currA = currA.next
            currB = currB.next

        return currA
```

上面的方案可以用以下超级简洁的代码表示：

```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if headA is None or headB is None:
            return None

        pa = headA # 2 pointers
        pb = headB

        while pa is not pb:
            # if either pointer hits the end, switch head and continue the second traversal,
            # if not hit the end, just move on to next
            pa = headB if pa is None else pa.next
            pb = headA if pb is None else pb.next

        return pa
        # only 2 ways to get out of the loop, they meet or the both hit the end=None

# the idea is if you switch head, the possible difference between length would be countered.
# On the second traversal, they either hit or miss.
# if they meet, pa or pb would be the node we are looking for,
# if they didn't meet, they will hit the end at the same iteration, pa == pb == None, return either one of them is the same,None


```

这个实现的思路还是分别遍历两个链表，然后找到他们的长度差别，然后并排跑的比较。但是这个方法速度比较慢，很奇怪

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        curA, curB = headA, headB
        begin, tailA, tailB = None, None, None

        while curA and curB:
            if curA == curB:
                begin = curA
                break

            if curA.next:
                curA = curA.next
            elif tailA is None:
                tailA = curA
                curA = headB
            else:
                break

            if curB.next:
                curB = curB.next
            elif tailB is None:
                tailB = curB
                curB = headA
            else:
                break

        return begin

```

时隔多年，自己手搓的代码，逻辑还是很简单的。

```python
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        m, n = 0, 0
        a, b = headA, headB
        while a:
            a = a.next
            m += 1
        while b:
            b = b.next
            n += 1
        if m > n:
            for _ in range(m - n):
                headA = headA.next
        else:
            for _ in range(n - m):
                headB = headB.next
        while headA != headB:
            headA = headA.next
            headB = headB.next
        return headA
```
