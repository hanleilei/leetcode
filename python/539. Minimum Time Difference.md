# Minimum Time Difference

[[2points]]

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.

Example 1:

Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
Output: 0

Constraints:

2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 104
timePoints[i] is in the format "HH:MM".

很简单的一个双指针。

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        time = sorted([int(i[:2]) * 60 + int(i[3:]) for i in timePoints], reverse=True)
        res = float("inf")
        
        for i in range(len(time) - 1):
            res = min(res, time[i] - time[i+1])
        return min(res, time[-1] + 1440 - time[0])
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        
        #If there are 2 matching timePoints then we can return 0
        if len(set(timePoints))< len(timePoints):
            return 0
        
        #Once we sort the least timestamp between any 2 points is only with adjacent values
        timePoints = sorted(timePoints)

        #Set to Maximum value difference can have
        minimum = 1440
        for i in range(len(timePoints)):
            pl = timePoints[i].split(":")
            #Convert timePoint to Nth minute of the day
            timePoints[i] = int(pl[0])*60 + int(pl[1])

        #Calculate the minimum difference between 2 timePoints
        for i in range(len(timePoints)-1):
            if timePoints[i+1] - timePoints[i] < minimum:
                minimum = timePoints[i+1] - timePoints[i]
        
        #Final edge case to compare between latest minute to the earliest minute on the next day
        if 1440 - timePoints[-1] + timePoints[0] < minimum:
            minimum = 1440 - timePoints[-1] + timePoints[0]
        
        return minimum
        
```
