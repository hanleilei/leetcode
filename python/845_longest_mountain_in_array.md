# longest mountain in array

Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a mountain if the following properties hold:

B.length >= 3
There exists some 0 < i < B.length - 1 such that B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]
(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.)

Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest mountain.

Return 0 if there is no mountain.



Example 1:
```
Input: [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.
```
思路：

生成两个列表，一个上升，一个下降，然后求和。
```python
class Solution:
    def longestMountain(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        up, down = [0] * len(A), [0] * len(A)
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            if A[i] > A[i - 1]: up[i] = up[i - 1] + 1
        for i in range(len(A) - 1)[::-1]:
            if A[i] > A[i + 1]: down[i] = down[i + 1] + 1
        return max([u + d + 1 for u, d in zip(up, down) if u and d] or [0])
```
