# Contains Duplicate III

Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false
```

整个题目就是滑动窗口+字典

```Python
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int, t: int) -> bool:
        if t==0 and len(nums)== len(set(nums)):
            return False
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(1,k+1):
                if i+j >= len(nums):break
                if abs(nums[i+j]-nums[i])<=t:return True
        return False
```

再来一个桶排序的方法：

```Python
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int, t: int) -> bool:
        # Bucket sort. Each bucket has size of t. For each number, the possible
        # candidate can only be in the same bucket or the two buckets besides.
        # Keep as many as k buckets to ensure that the difference is at most k.
        buckets = {}
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            # t == 0 is a special case where we only have to check the bucket
            # that v is in.
            bucketNum, offset = (v // t, 1) if t else (v, 0)
            for idx in range(bucketNum - offset, bucketNum + offset + 1):
                if idx in buckets and abs(buckets[idx] - nums[i]) <= t:
                    return True

            buckets[bucketNum] = nums[i]
            if len(buckets) > k:
                # Remove the bucket which is too far away. Beware of zero t.
                del buckets[nums[i - k] // t if t else nums[i - k]]

        return False

```
