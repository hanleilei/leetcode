# find the town judge

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```
Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 1000
- 0 <= trust.length <= 104
- trust[i].length == 2
- All the pairs of trust are unique.
- ai != bi
- 1 <= ai, bi <= n



Intuition:
Consider trust as a graph, all pairs are directed edge.
The point with in-degree - out-degree = N - 1 become the judge.

Explanation:
Count the degree, and check at the end.

Time Complexity:
Time O(T + N), space O(N)

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, N: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i, j in trust:
            count[i] -= 1
            count[j] += 1
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if count[i] == N - 1:
                return i
        return -1
```
