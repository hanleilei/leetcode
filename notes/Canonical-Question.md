# Canonical

What about Canonical interests you the most?
when I first know Canonical, it's Ubuntu 6.04, which I used this version of Linux as my desktop for almost 2 years.

Why does this particular opportunity interest you?
first, there are thousands of linux public distribute version, develop a new one and make it popular more than 15 years, this is a very cool thing. I wish we can make it more cool in the following 15 years or moore.

Describe your Python software engineering skill, and how did you gain this experience?
before start to develop using python, I'm a Perl fan, a lot of knowledge can be reused. then, I learned from offical document; some website such as pymotw.com, stackoverflow; youtube channel, such as David Beazley and books, my favorite book is python cookbook 3rd edition and fluent python. the most import part is learn by doing or fix real world problem.

How familiar are you with Linux operations - including networking and storage - and how did you gain this experience?
as a 20 years linux user, I feel very convenient to work in linux environment.

What experience do you have with site reliability engineering, keeping production services online and available?
I have few experience with SRE role, but as a devops, I suppose I'm lack of experience to setup and config alert and monitor tools.

Describe your experience with container and cloud technologies (Docker, LXD, Kubernetes, Openstack, Ceph, Public Cloud, etc)
if I need to use some software, I will try to find their docker image first. during my previous work, I had used Google Cloud and Azure. we had plan to put all the company application into a signle kubernete cluster.

What makes for an ideal devops engineering colleague?
know more about upstream and downstream, such as domain bussiness/logic, automatic test framework, storage, network etc.

What are the key trends in infra-as-code?
maybe some other tools such as Pulumi will be more popular. software engineer can use their most familiar programming language to maintain infrastructure, instead to learning a obsecture DSL(such as terraform)

What could be improved in the state of the art of devops?
use IDE, version everything and gitops

How are you involved in open source software?
as a perl fan, I had join chinese Perl group, translate a lot of perl offical document from english to chinese.

How did you fare in secondary school mathematics, physical sciences and computing? Which were strengths and which were most enjoyable? How did you rank, competitively, in them?
in the engineering view, the math is quite important, I had take engineering math and quite enjoy it. it describe a lot of lab strategy which can resolve problems in the real world.

Which degree and university did you choose, and why?
microelectronics, I thought the micro mechanic structure is quite cool. finally I know the process, it's not cool at all, almost the same as Gutenberg' movable-type printing press.

What did you enjoy most about your time at university?
play civilization III with my friends. and learning a lot of history from that game.

Outside of class, what were your interests and where did you spend your time?
the same as answer above.

What did you achieve at university that you consider exceptional?
build a transistor by ourself in academy's lab with teacher help. every process is made by ourself.

How do you think Canonical could improve Ubuntu and its cloud offerings?
it's pretty hard, due to cloud is owned by several big cloud provider: aws, azure, gcp etc. the only choose is to get cooperate with these big cloud provider.

What do you think are the most significant strengths of Canonical's competitors?

such as redhat, is bought by IBM, will have all the IBM big enterprise as customer.
