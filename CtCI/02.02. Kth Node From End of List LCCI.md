# Kth Node From End of List LCCI

Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list. Return the value of the element.

Note: This problem is slightly different from the original one in the book.

Example:

Input:  1->2->3->4->5 和 k = 2
Output:  4
Note:

k is always valid.

经典的问题：

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def kthToLast(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> int:
        p = ListNode(0)
        p.next = head
        size = 0
        while p.next:
            size += 1
            p = p.next
        for _ in range(size - k):
            head = head.next
        return head.val
```
