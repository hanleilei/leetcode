# 01.04. Palindrome Permutation LCCI

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

 

Example:

Input: "tactcoa"
Output: true（permutations: "tacocat"、"atcocta", etc.）


```python
class Solution:
    def canPermutePalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        c = dict(Counter(s))
        flag = False
        for k,v in c.items():
            if v % 2:
                if flag:
                    return False
                else:
                    flag = True
        return True
```
