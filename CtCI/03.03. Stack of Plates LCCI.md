# 03.03. Stack of Plates LCCI

Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack). Follow Up: Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.

You should delete the sub-stack when it becomes empty. pop, popAt should return -1 when there's no element to pop.

Example1:

 Input: 
["StackOfPlates", "push", "push", "popAt", "pop", "pop"]
[[1], [1], [2], [1], [], []]
 Output: 
[null, null, null, 2, 1, -1]
 Explanation: 
Example2:

 Input: 
["StackOfPlates", "push", "push", "push", "popAt", "popAt", "popAt"]
[[2], [1], [2], [3], [0], [0], [0]]
 Output: 
[null, null, null, null, 2, 1, 3]

```python
class StackOfPlates:

    def __init__(self, cap: int):
        self.stack = [[]]
        self.cap = cap

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        # print("push", self.stack)
        if self.cap < 1:
            return
        if len(self.stack[-1]) >= self.cap:
            self.stack.append([])
        self.stack[-1].append(val)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        # print("pop", self.stack)
        tmp = -1
        if self.stack and self.stack[-1]:
            tmp = self.stack[-1].pop()
        else:
            return tmp
        if len(self.stack) > 1 and not self.stack[-1]:
            self.stack.pop()
        return tmp

    def popAt(self, index: int) -> int:
        # print("popAt", index, self.stack)
        tmp = -1
        if index < len(self.stack) and self.stack[index]:
            tmp = self.stack[index].pop()
        else:
            return tmp
        if len(self.stack) > 1 and len(self.stack[index]) == 0:
            self.stack.pop(index)
        return tmp


# Your StackOfPlates object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = StackOfPlates(cap)
# obj.push(val)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.popAt(index)
