# 02.04. Partition List LCCI

Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

Example:

Input: head = 3->5->8->5->10->2->1, x = 5
Output: 3->1->2->10->5->5->8

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* partition(ListNode* head, int x) {
        ListNode* big = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* small = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode *sd = small,*bd = big;
        while( head != nullptr){
            if (head->val < x){
                small->next = head;
                small = small->next;
            }else{
                big->next = head;
                big = big->next;
            }
            head = head->next;
        }
        small->next = bd->next;
        big->next = nullptr;
        return sd->next;

    }
};
```
