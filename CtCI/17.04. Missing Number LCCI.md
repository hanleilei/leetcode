# Missing Number LCCI

An array contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing.  Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?

Note: This problem is slightly different from the original one the book.

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
 

Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8


```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(range(len(nums) + 1)) - sum(nums)
```
